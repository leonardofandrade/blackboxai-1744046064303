# User Management Project

## Project Overview
User Management Project is a Django-based web application designed to help manage user registrations, profiles, and authentication processes in a straightforward and efficient manner. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for managing user data while ensuring adherence to best practices in web development.

## Installation
To get started with the User Management Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UserManagementProject.git
   cd UserManagementProject
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Django**:
   Make sure to install Django within your virtual environment.

   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   After installation, run the following command to set up your database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser** (optional):
   If you'd like to manage your project via the admin interface, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   Start the server to access the project in your browser:
